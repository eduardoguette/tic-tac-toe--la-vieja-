## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus**: Save the game state in the browser so that it‚Äôs preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it‚Äôs proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

### What I learned

This is my second game! In this opportunity I learned to develop a CPU. This is great! Although this CPU is not lot smart. üò¢ but is able to play with you üòÄ.

Also I developed a function for detected when a player won the game
check out in the next line. 


```js
export function handleWinner(moves, player) {
  let result = []
  const movesWiners = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [3, 6, 9],
    [1, 5, 9],
    [3, 5, 7]
  ]
  for (let i in movesWiners) {
    result = []
    moves.forEach((item) => {
      if (
        item.selected &&
        item.player === player &&
        movesWiners[i].includes(item.id)
      )
        result.push(item.id)
        
    })

    if (result.length > 2) return player
  }
}
```
 

### Continued development

I want to continue developing my CPU. I want to make it more smart. I want to make it able to play with me. üòÅ
